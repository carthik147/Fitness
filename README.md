The AI-Based Fitness Tracker is a machine learning-powered system designed to accurately estimate calorie expenditure based on user activity data. Traditional calorie estimation methods often lack precision due to generalized formulas, but this project leverages advanced AI models to improve accuracy.

The system involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify the most effective machine learning algorithm for calorie estimation. It utilizes Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and other models, comparing their performance based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. A Flask-based web application is developed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for tracking fitness data in real time.

This project aims to bridge the gap in existing fitness tracking solutions by integrating AI-driven predictions with personalized insights, helping users make better health and fitness decisions. ðŸš€
